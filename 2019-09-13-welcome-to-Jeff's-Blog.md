 For my week of Cit DEsign we worked on creating a docker file. The steps involved included creating a new container
 in docker, followed by upgrading the new list of repositories. We then installed a file editor i.e. Nano. We then
 installed apache 2 , mysql, php and the required php packages. We created a info.php file and then cloned a 
git affinity project repository. Finally this created a working application for our container. We then installed composer.
Whivh is a dependency manager for php.We finished the lab by creating the docker file. I ran into a few problems mostly 
due to incorrect syntax but corrected them.
