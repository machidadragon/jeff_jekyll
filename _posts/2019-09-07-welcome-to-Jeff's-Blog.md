Hi I'm in CIT Design and this is my first weeks post. We installed Dockers and set up a blog. I installed Docker to my PC, I tried to install it first on my mac but was unsuccessful because the OS wasn't capable. I had a version too old for Docker. Anyways I got it running on my pc. I then set up a blog on github using jekyll. I used the command jekyll new Myblog to build the site. I then provided the modifications to make it work.I had to push the info to github and commit it. This was a very good learning experience for me.
