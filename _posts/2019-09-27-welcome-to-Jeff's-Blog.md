 This week in CIT design we worked on the implementation of ansible playbooks. We created two
seperate playbooks one creating two groups and giving one of the groups sudo powers(Admin)
The other group cit480 was given Trace route usage capabilitites. The second playbook installed  
a LAMP stack into localhost via a dokcer container. I installed Apache2, MYSQL, PHP and the 
7.1 PHP dependencies, we then cloned the repository and made config changes to the apacheconfig files
I then installed composer to complete the lamp stack. Issues were mostly syntax related. 
We then tested our installation against localhost to make sure they were effective.
