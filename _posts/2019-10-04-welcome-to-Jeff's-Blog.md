 This week in CIT design we worked primarily on a group project involving AWS. We created a AWS account and set up a  
github page to display our work. On our group page we have an ansible playbook and some readme files as well as 
some cloud programming we are working on. We will purchase a domain and set up a virtual private could. We also plan to set
up a webserver cloud computing. The specifications for the VPC is as  follows:
?	3 public subnets in 3 different availability zones (AZ) with at least 1024 available IP addresses per subnet.
?	3 private subnets in 3 different availability zones (AZ) with at least 4096 available IP addresses per subnet.
?	1 route table for the public subnets
?	1 route table for the private subnets
?	1 Internet Gateway (IG) attached to the default route of the public subnet routing table
 We have begun work on this project and will continue through this week.
