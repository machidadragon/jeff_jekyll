 This week for our design class we continued our project consisting of:
-Establishing private and public subnets
-Set up and Internet Gateway 
-Set up two security groups 
-created an ec2 instance on aws 
-ssh into the ec2 using public dns address
-Set up Route 53 on AWS
-Purchased a domain
-Created an A record 
-We istalled an Apache2 server on the ec2 instance 
-We created and modifyed the index.html page
-And currently working on adding the letscrypt which will give us needed security


Many problems encountered included issues with changing file wnership in windows , use of
Cygwin not operating correctly, and even a few issues early on with the selecting subnets
large enough for our needs.
