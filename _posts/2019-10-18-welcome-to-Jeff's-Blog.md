 This week for our design class we finished our project consisting of:
-Establishing private and public subnets
-Set up and Internet Gateway 
-Set up two security groups 
-created an ec2 instance on aws 
-ssh into the ec2 using public dns address
-Set up Route 53 on AWS
-Purchased a domain
-Created an A record 
-We installed an Apache2 server on the ec2 instance 
-We created and modifyed the index.html page
-And we added TLS security.

Issues we faced were mostly due to learning AWS and learning to operate in their enviroment. 
We also created a presentation to present to the class on our work.
