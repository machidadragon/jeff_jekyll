             This week I worked on setting up a web page for my website.
 Once into my ec2 I created 3 files. Index.html is the file that holds 
the basic page structure that is being served by the apache server. 
In this page I included a link to an href. <link rel="stylesheet" href
="login-page.css"> This allows me to link the file for my css style 
sheet to my main file(webpage structure). I defined all my styles on the
css page and tested to make sure they were updated when they were 
changed. I next included a link to my javascript file.<script src= "login-
page.js"> In this file I had all my javascipt for my page which currently 
I'm working on a login webpage. I included a button that allows the 
user to enter into a textbox a name and a password. This is done from 
the main page by <button onclick="myfunction()">Submit</button>. With 
this your info is submitted and handled by the javascript. While the page 
is at https://www.lv426sitea.com it maybe down since it is a bit pricey 
to always have it on. So as of now it is "On by  request".
